# Conference Assistant Application

Problem: It’s always complicated to build good communication between speaker and audience on big events. Some people are too shy, some topics are too interesting and there are often too many people that want to ask something. We don’t have enough microphones for staff. And it takes a lot of time. Some questions are have nothing in common with the current topic.

Solution: 
We’ve built an interactive application that will make asking questions comfortable for everyone in conferences. Visitors are able to see other questions and vote for the most interesting ones. So the conference staff could choose and read only the most relevant questions.
